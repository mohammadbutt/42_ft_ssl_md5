# 42_ft_ssl_md5: Cryptographic hashing algorithms that provide communications security over computer network

### Pupose of the project is to recode md5(1) and openSSL(sha256) hashing algorithm.
### md5 - Takes an input message of any length and produces digital fingerprint.
### openSSL (sha2) - Are series of Algorithms that take a message and generates a 256-bit(224-bit) digital fingerprint.
