# 42_ft_ssl_md5: Cryptographic hashing algorithms that provide communications security over computer network

### Pupose of the project is to recode and md5(1) and openSSL(sha256) hashing algorithm.
### md5 - md5 takes an input message of any length and produces as a output a fingerprint or message digest of the input.
### openSSL (sha2) - sha2 are series of Algorithms that take a message and generates a 256-bit(224-bit) digest from the input.
